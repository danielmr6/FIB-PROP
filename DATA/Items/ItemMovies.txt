Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo (Jean Reno) are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family).  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.¬popularity¬13.503815¬poster_path¬/w4TWqa7SiXP0Hm4rkRnCfXwIeRK.jpg¬production_companies¬Gaumont¬production_countries¬¬release_date¬1988-05-11¬revenue¬0¬runtime¬168¬spoken_languages¬en;fr;it¬status¬Released¬tagline¬Danger...Like Passion...Runs Deep¬title¬The Big Blue¬video¬False¬vote_average¬7.6¬vote_count¬364¬keywords¬italy;suicide;diving;ocean;competition;father son relationship;oxygen;sicily;dolphin;apnoe-diving;dying and death;friendship

While a fugitive from the law, De Marney is helped by heroine Nova Pilbeam, who three years earlier had played the adolescent kidnap victim in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much. The obligatory "fish out of water" scene, in which the principals are briefly slowed down by a banal everyday event, occurs during a child's birthday party. The actual villain, whose identity is never in doubt (Hitchcock made thrillers, not mysteries) is played by George Curzon, who suffers from a twitching eye. Curzon's revelation during an elaborate nightclub sequence is a Hitchcockian tour de force, the sort of virtuoso sequence taken for granted in these days of flexible cameras and computer enhancement, but which in 1937 took a great deal of time, patience and talent to pull off. Released in the US as The Girl Was Young, Young and Innocent was based on a novel by Josephine Tey.¬popularity¬3.824884¬poster_path¬/8teH96d4Hcg1BWwCePXcuHrcYxw.jpg¬production_companies¬Gaumont British Picture Corporation¬production_countries¬¬release_date¬1937-11-01¬revenue¬0¬runtime¬83¬spoken_languages¬en¬status¬Released¬tagline¬A Brilliant Melodrama¬title¬Young and Innocent¬video¬False¬vote_average¬6.8¬vote_count¬42¬keywords¬falsely accused;country house;murder;suspense

He commissioned the German agent Max Richard (Armen Dzhigarkhanian) to carry out his plan, but it failed miserably due to the quick action and thinking of Andrei. While in Teheran, Andrei met a French woman, Marie Louni (Natalia Belokhvostikova), living in the city and they had a brief but intense affair. Nearly four decades later, the Nazi officer has been captured - but not for long. Freed by terrorists, the officer is hunting down the German agent who failed to carry out the planned assassinations.

While most teams had only limited success at best, one managed to break through to genuine mainstream popularity - the New York Cosmos. The brainchild of Steve Ross (Major executive at Warner Communications) and the Ertegun brothers (Founders of Atlantic Records), the Cosmos got off to a rocky start in 1971, but things changed in 1975 when the world's most celebrated soccer star, the Brazilian champion Pele, signed with the Cosmos for a five-million-dollar payday. With the arrival of Pele, the Cosmos became a hit  and the players became the toast of the town, earning their own private table at Studio 54. A number of other international soccer stars were soon lured to the Cosmos, including Franz Beckenbauer, Rodney Marsh, and Carlos Alberto, but with the turn of the decade, the team began losing favor with fans and folded in 1985.¬popularity¬0.110813¬poster_path¬/mYpgwxTLhCTHoA0LXyRAYhTcpUi.jpg¬production_companies¬¬production_countries¬¬release_date¬2006-01-01¬revenue¬0¬runtime¬97¬spoken_languages¬en¬status¬Released¬tagline¬The untold story of the team that had America at its feet.¬title¬Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos¬video¬False¬vote_average¬4.7¬vote_count¬3¬keywords¬new york;beckenbauer;pele

It is 1824. Beethoven is racing to finish his new symphony. However, it has been years since his last success and he is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma. A copyist is urgently needed to help the composer. A fictional character is introduced in the form of a young conservatory student and aspiring composer named Anna Holtz. The mercurial Beethoven is skeptical that a woman might become involved in his masterpiece but slowly comes to trust in Anna's assistance and in the end becomes quite fond of her. By the time the piece is performed, her presence in his life is an absolute necessity. Her deep understanding of his work is such that she even corrects mistakes he has made, while her passionate personality opens a door into his private world.¬popularity¬2.331416¬poster_path¬/jxyqka5Wfcdt7FZ3r9q6ZmGCcRP.jpg¬production_companies¬Sidney Kimmel Entertainment;Anomaly Entertainment¬production_countries¬¬release_date¬2006-09-10¬revenue¬0¬runtime¬104¬spoken_languages¬de¬status¬Released¬tagline¬¬title¬Copying Beethoven¬video¬False¬vote_average¬6.3¬vote_count¬44¬keywords¬beethoven;woman director

In Toshio Matsumoto’s controversial debut feature, seemingly nothing is taboo: neither the incorporation of visual flourishes straight from the worlds of contemporary graphic-design, painting, comic-books, and animation; nor the unflinching depiction of nudity, sex, drug-use, and public-toilets. But of all the “transgressions” here on display, perhaps one in particular stands out the most: the film’s groundbreaking and unapologetic portrayal of Japanese gay subculture.¬popularity¬3.502077¬poster_path¬/v2HfNo9eLNHvN6Rh9BQiJBVGDPQ.jpg¬production_companies¬Art Theatre Guild¬production_countries¬¬release_date¬1969-01-01¬revenue¬0¬runtime¬104¬spoken_languages¬ja¬status¬Released¬tagline¬The trials and tribulations of Eddie and other transvestites in Japan.¬title¬Funeral Parade of Roses¬video¬False¬vote_average¬7.1¬vote_count¬21¬keywords¬oedipus

The result, complete with a chorus of gentlemen of Japan as cartoon-like British peers, emphatically underscores the Englishness of the satire. The occasional non sequiturs, like a bunch of gentry dressed for Ascot and singing in Japanese, are loonily fun, and no more absurd than the fantasyland Japan that Gilbert and Sullivan invented. The time frame, though, seems little more than an excuse for a smart black-and-white production design.¬popularity¬0.070858¬poster_path¬/5Ush72mvbLcGLPQI41Wo0j94F5r.jpg¬production_companies¬¬production_countries¬¬release_date¬1987-01-01¬revenue¬0¬runtime¬130¬spoken_languages¬¬status¬Released¬tagline¬Operetta, Musical¬title¬The Mikado¬video¬False¬vote_average¬0.0¬vote_count¬0¬keywords¬

As the vicious Olga (Audrey Campbell) expands her criminal empire, she also encounters more resistance as a string of once-trusted partners turn traitor in an effort to steal the successful racket out from under her. The result is exactly what fans of the series expect, a barrage of torture scenes featuring soldering irons, floggings, spankings, and even an electric chair. As with its predecessors, Olga's House of Shame is a silent black and white film with narration to explain the action, but even with direct commentary it's difficult to keep track of the characters and Campbell (who is occasionally caught laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all) has all the menace of a kindergarten teacher, even when wielding a machete.¬popularity¬0.151701¬poster_path¬/oampyuoWprKn3iimYJeU8GhpkmQ.jpg¬production_companies¬¬production_countries¬¬release_date¬1964-02-06¬revenue¬0¬runtime¬70¬spoken_languages¬en¬status¬Released¬tagline¬Bodies Racked by Unspeakable Tortures!
